# 📚 Alsafwa Encyclopedia

The **Alsafwa Encyclopedia** is a digital archive dedicated to documenting and presenting the biographies of *imams, preachers, teachers, and muezzins* of Al-Masjid Al-Nabawi (the Prophet’s Mosque in Madinah).  
This project transforms a rich Word-based collection into an interactive website that allows users to search, filter, and browse historical figures alphabetically, by role, or by century.
